<p>What happens if your main stylesheet fails to load because the user is on a flaky connection, maybe on a train (this happens to me all the time)? The page might still render without styles.
</p>

<p>If you have a decent HTML structure, the page will still be readable, but your icons will end up really big.
</p>

<p>
    To prevent your icons from being really big if your stylesheet doesn't load, use this code in the head of your html document:
<pre>
 &lt;style&gt;.icon {
     width: 1em;
     height: 1em
 }&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>

</p>
<img src="example.png" style="width: 50%;">
