<!--We can change all this with the first positioning property we'll learn: the display property.
We'll learn about four possible values.-->

<!--block:
This makes the element a block box.
It won't let anything sit next to it on the page!
It takes up the full width.-->

<!--inline-block:
This makes the element a block box,
but will allow other elements to sit next to it on the same line.-->

<!--inline:
This makes the element sit on the same line as another element,
but without formatting it like a block.
It only takes up as much width as it needs (not the whole line).-->

<!--none:
This makes the element and its content disappear from the page entirely!-->
