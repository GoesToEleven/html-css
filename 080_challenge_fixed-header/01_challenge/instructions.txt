Using the webpage you created in the previous challenge, add a header area to the top of the page which will remain fixed as we scroll the page.

This header area should be about 50 - 100 px in height.

In a future challenege, we will add content to this header area, but don't add content to it now.

You may need to refactor your code so that your HTML uses different elements in different areas.
