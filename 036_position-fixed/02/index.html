<!--This type of positioning is fairly rare but certainly has its uses.
A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself.
The viewport doesn't change when the window is scrolled, so a fixed positioned element will stay
right where it is when the page is scrolled (css-tricks)-->
